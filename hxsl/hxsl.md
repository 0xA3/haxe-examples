# HXSL
This is a little tutorial on how to get into the Haxe Shader Language that is used by the Heaps Game Engine.  

When I first learned that Heaps has it's own shader language I was sceptical. Of course it could be easier to write shaders in Haxe code, but there are many tutorials and thousands of example shaders for the standard shading languages. How hard would it be to convert those examples to HXSL?

Well, turns out it's pretty easy.  

To try out my examples, first install the [Heaps Game Engine](https://heaps.io/). I used version 1.8.0. In newer versions it may be different.  
Please make sure you know how to create and run an application in Heaps.

A great resource to learn about shaders is [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/). So how do their examples look in HXSL?
